The data file includes all the necessary information to plot pixel-based visual representations of routes. It contains details such as route paths, shape IDs, and corresponding coordinates. Users can input starting and ending points (from and to). If the specified route is valid, the program will plot the points along the path. If the route is invalid, the user will receive a notification indicating that the selected route cannot be processed.
